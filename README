Sentiment analysis is a crucial application of natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in textual data. 
In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using various machine learning models. 
The chosen dataset consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, and we aim to build and evaluate models to predict sentiment based on text.
